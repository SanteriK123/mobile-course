Repository for all of my personal files relating to Software Development Skills: Mobile course.

To run the project, download the entire "Project" folder and place it into your AndroidStudioProjects folder, usually located in C:\Users\username\AndroidStudioProjects
Open Android Studio, and the "Project" folder should appear with the other projects. If not, you can browse for the file from top left of the screen, press "File" and the folder should appear within the AndroidStudioProjects folder. Just double click the "Project" folder and it will open it.
When you have the project open, simply make sure you have an android emulator device installed, and the press the "Run app" button on the top right of the screen, and Gradle will compile the program.
